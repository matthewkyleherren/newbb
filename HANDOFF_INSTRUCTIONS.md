```

## Next Steps

### 1️⃣ Give This Package to Claude Code

Open a **Claude Code session** and tell it:

> "I have a locally downloaded REKKI website at [your path]. I want you to replace all the English text with BigBites German/Swiss German content. I'm giving you a handoff package - start by reading `/mnt/user-data/outputs/bigbites-redesign/brief/CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md`"

### 2️⃣ Claude Code Will:

- Read the main handoff document
- Ask you which language (recommend Swiss German for more character!)
- Systematically replace all REKKI text with BigBites text
- Handle both HTML and JavaScript files
- Preserve all design, styling, and functionality
- Test the result

### 3️⃣ You'll Get:

A prototype that:
- ✅ Looks like REKKI (proven design)
- ✅ Reads like BigBites (your aggressive Swiss content)
- ✅ Works locally in your browser
- ✅ Let's you test if the style works for BigBites

## Timeline

- **Claude Code work**: 1-2 hours
- **Your review**: However long you need
- **Iterations**: Quick (just text changes)

## The Strategy

### Why This Approach?

Instead of building from scratch, we're:
1. Using REKKI's proven design as a foundation
2. Swapping in your aggressive BigBites content
3. Creating a working prototype to test the style
4. Deciding if you like it before committing to a full build

### After the Prototype

**If you love it:**
- Customize colors/branding
- Replace images
- Deploy it

**If you want changes:**
- Easy to iterate (just text files)
- Can adjust tone/content
- Quick turnaround

**If you want something different:**
- Use the full IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Build custom Next.js site from scratch
- Have complete creative control

## Key Features of the Handoff

✅ **Complete text mappings** - Every piece of REKKI text → BigBites equivalent
✅ **Step-by-step instructions** - Claude Code knows exactly what to do
✅ **Both languages ready** - German and Swiss German versions
✅ **Verified claims** - All commission rates double-checked
✅ **Troubleshooting** - Solutions for common issues
✅ **Testing procedures** - How to verify it works

## Important Notes

### Commission Rates ⚠️
All verified and defensible:
- Uber Eats Premium: 30% ✅
- Industry range: 15-30% ✅
- BigBites: 8% or CHF 350 ✅

### Romansh Warning ⚠️
The Romansh content is AI-generated and **must be reviewed by a native speaker** before any public use.

### Language Recommendation 🇨🇭
I recommend starting with **Swiss German** because:
- More authentic for Swiss audience
- Better matches the aggressive, no-BS tone
- More memorable and distinctive
- Shows you're genuinely Swiss, not just operating in Switzerland

## What Makes This Package Special

1. **Ready for immediate execution** - Claude Code can start right away
2. **No ambiguity** - Every text replacement is mapped out
3. **Handles complexity** - Text in HTML AND JavaScript
4. **Preserves functionality** - Only replaces content, never breaks code
5. **Built-in verification** - Testing procedures included
6. **Language options** - Choose your preferred tone

## Files You'll Reference

**For Claude Code:**
- `brief/CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md` - Main instruction manual
- `brief/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - While working

**For Your Review:**
- `content/ch-de/homepage.md` - See exact Swiss German text
- `content/de/homepage.md` - See exact German text
- `README.md` - Package overview

## Expected Deliverable

When Claude Code is done, you'll have:

```
rekki-site/ (your modified copy)
├── index.html              <- Now in German/Swiss German
├── platform.html           <- BigBites Platform content
├── partners.html           <- BigBites Partners content  
├── hardware.html           <- BigBites Hardware content
├── web.html                <- BigBites Web content
├── js/
│   └── main.js            <- Strings also replaced
└── [all other files]      <- Styling/structure intact
```

Open `index.html` in your browser = Working prototype! 🎉

## Quick Start Command

For Claude Code:

```
Read /mnt/user-data/outputs/bigbites-redesign/brief/CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md
Then ask me for the path to my REKKI site and let's begin!
```

## Questions?

The package is self-documenting:
- Start with README.md
- Main instructions in CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md
- Everything else supports those two files

## What This Enables

**Short term:**
- Test if REKKI's aggressive style works for BigBites
- Show founders/stakeholders a real prototype
- Make decisions based on something tangible

**Long term:**
- Keep it and customize, OR
- Build fresh with lessons learned
- Either way, you're not guessing anymore
